# Dementia Prediction
## About

In this project, we'll explore a comprehensive analysis of a dementia patients dataset.  
Our objective is to clean this data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply several machine learning models to predict whether a person has dementia based on it's attribute.

Note that there are 1 original & 3 cleaned version of the dataset, which would be separated for comparison purposes.

## Problem
Dataset: [Dementia Patient Health,Prescriptions ML Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggler2412/dementia-patient-health-and-prescriptions-dataset/data)  
Context: Predict whether person has dementia by training classification models based on attributes mention in dataset.  
Problem Definition: Are we able to predict dementia with based on its attributes and if so, can we find the most important attribute?

## Model Used
Logistic Regression
* Training a Logistic Regression model to predict dementia with our dataset and using coefficients to determine the most important variable.

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
* Training a Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) model to predict dementia with our dataset and confirming the effects of the presence/absence of the most important variable on the predictions.

## Conclusion
Through this effort to predict dementia by data analysis and statistical modelling, we've found that:
* Logistic Regresion and MLP performs very well (95+% accuracy and F1 Score) on our dataset, but MLP performs substantially less accurately(60% accuracy and 59% F1 Score) compared to Logistic Regresion model(74% accuracy and 75% F1 Score) when data is incomplete/ when most important variable is absent.
* By calculating Coefficients, we found out that Cognitive_Test_Score has the highest coefficient and thus is the most important attribute that determines/predicts whether a person has dementia.
* When we train our MLP model on our dataset for 100 epochs, our model is learning well without experiencing significant overfitting, as both losses hold true over multiple epochs.
* For real life situation, when data may not be fully complete, it may be better to use logistic regression to predict dementia.

## What we have learned
* Various machine learning model from regression to neural network.
* Different optimizer, overfitting vs underfitting.
* How to clean datasets to make the datatypes better suited for machine learning model.
* Handling imbalanced datasets through resampling/(fit_transforms).
* Different models(Logistic Regression, MLP)
* Neural Networks(Tensorflow)
